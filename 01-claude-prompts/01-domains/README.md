# Domain Prompt Packs

Each file in this folder summarises one bounded context from `00_docs/02-system-analysis/domain-model.md` and links to the supporting specs (use cases, data dictionary, design docs). Paste the relevant domain brief before asking Claude to implement or refactor logic in that area.

**Token rule:** If you need deeper detail, pull only the specific subsection from:
- `00_docs/02-system-analysis/domain-model.md`
- `00_docs/04-detail-design/03-business-logic-flows.md`
- `00_docs/04-detail-design/01-entity-specifications.md`
- Matching use cases under `00_docs/02-system-analysis/use-cases`
