# Documentation Standards (Claude Prompt)

**Guidelines**
- Update relevant prompts/docs when behaviour changes.
- Keep README sections under 200 tokens for Claude-friendliness.
- Include citations/links to source specs when possible.
- Use tables for structured data (limits, enums) to improve readability.

## Claude tips
- Encourage Claude to add doc updates as part of implementation tasks, not afterwards.
