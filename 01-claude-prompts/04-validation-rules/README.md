# Validation Rule Prompts

These prompts summarise validation logic from `00_docs/04-detail-design/05-validation-rules.md`. Use them to brief Claude before implementing forms, DTOs, or backend validators.

**Tip:** Pull only the section relevant to your entity to avoid pasting the entire validation document.
