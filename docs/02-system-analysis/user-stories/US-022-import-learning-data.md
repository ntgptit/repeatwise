# US-022: Import Learning Data

## User Story

**As a** user  
**I want to** import learning data from external sources  
**So that** I can transfer my learning progress from other platforms or restore from backups

## Story Details

### Background
Users need to be able to import learning data from various sources such as other learning platforms, backup files, or data exports. This functionality enables data portability and allows users to consolidate their learning data in one place.

### User Value
- Transfer learning progress from other platforms
- Restore data from backups
- Consolidate learning data from multiple sources
- Migrate from other learning applications
- Maintain learning continuity across platforms

### Business Value
- Support data portability requirements
- Enable user migration from competitors
- Improve user retention through data continuity
- Support compliance with data protection regulations
- Provide competitive advantage through data import capabilities
