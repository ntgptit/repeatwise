## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Basic Registration Flow
**Given** I am a new user accessing the app for the first time  
**When** I choose to register for an account  
**Then** I should see a registration form with required fields  
**And** I should be able to enter my email, password, and personal information  
**And** I should receive immediate feedback on input validation

### AC-002: Email Validation
**Given** I am filling out the registration form  
**When** I enter an email address  
**Then** the system should validate the email format in real-time  
**And** I should see a green checkmark if the email is valid  
**And** I should see a red error message if the email format is invalid  
**And** I should see an error if the email is already registered

### AC-003: Password Requirements
**Given** I am creating a password  
**When** I enter a password  
**Then** the system should show password strength requirements:
- Minimum 8 characters
- Maximum 20 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 lowercase letter
- At least 1 number
**And** I should see a password strength indicator  
**And** I should see a green checkmark when all requirements are met

### AC-004: Password Confirmation
**Given** I have entered a valid password  
**When** I enter the password confirmation  
**Then** the system should check if both passwords match  
**And** I should see a green checkmark if they match  
**And** I should see a red error message if they don't match

### AC-005: Personal Information
**Given** I am filling out the registration form  
**When** I enter my full name  
**Then** the system should accept names up to 100 characters  
**And** I should see an error if the name field is empty  
**And** I should see an error if the name exceeds 100 characters

### AC-006: Language and Timezone Selection
**Given** I am setting up my preferences  
**When** I select my preferred language and timezone  
**Then** I should be able to choose between Vietnamese (VI) and English (EN)  
**And** I should be able to select my timezone from a dropdown list  
**And** the system should default to Vietnamese and Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh timezone

### AC-007: Reminder Time Setting
**Given** I am setting up my learning preferences  
**When** I choose my default reminder time  
**Then** I should be able to select a time between 00:00 and 23:59  
**And** the system should default to 09:00  
**And** I should see a preview of when reminders will be sent

### AC-008: Successful Registration
**Given** I have filled out all required fields correctly  
**When** I submit the registration form  
**Then** my account should be created successfully  
**And** I should receive a confirmation email  
**And** I should be redirected to the main dashboard  
**And** I should see a welcome message and onboarding tour

### AC-009: Email Confirmation
**Given** I have successfully registered  
**When** I check my email  
**Then** I should receive a confirmation email within 30 seconds  
**And** the email should contain a verification link  
**And** the email should have a professional design with the RepeatWise branding

### AC-010: Error Handling
**Given** I encounter an error during registration  
**When** the system cannot complete my registration  
**Then** I should see a clear error message explaining what went wrong  
**And** I should be able to retry the registration process  
**And** my form data should be preserved (except for password fields)

### AC-011: Network Error Handling
**Given** I lose internet connection during registration  
**When** I try to submit the form  
**Then** I should see a network error message  
**And** I should have the option to retry when connection is restored  
**And** my form data should be saved locally

### AC-012: Rate Limiting
**Given** I attempt to register multiple times  
**When** I make more than 5 registration attempts per hour  
**Then** I should see a rate limiting message  
**And** I should be asked to wait before trying again  
**And** the system should log these attempts for security monitoring

## Story Points

**Story Points**: 8 (Medium complexity)

### Complexity Factors
- Email validation and confirmation flow
- Password security requirements
- Rate limiting implementation
- Error handling for multiple scenarios
- Integration with email service
- Accessibility requirements

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **US-002**: User Login (for post-registration flow)
- **US-003**: User Profile Management (for preference settings)
- **Database Schema**: Users table must be created
- **Email Service**: Must be configured and tested
- **Security Framework**: Spring Security must be set up

### Business Dependencies
- **Legal**: Privacy policy and terms of service must be finalized
- **Marketing**: Welcome email template must be designed
- **Support**: Support team must be trained on registration process

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Email Service Integration**: Dependency on external email service
- **Security**: Password handling and rate limiting
- **Performance**: Registration process must be fast

### Medium Risk
- **User Experience**: Complex validation requirements
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance requirements
- **Error Handling**: Multiple error scenarios to handle

### Low Risk
- **UI/UX**: Standard registration form design
- **Database**: Simple user table structure
- **Testing**: Standard testing approaches

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. User opens app and selects "Register"
2. User fills out form with valid data
3. User submits form
4. Account is created and confirmation email sent
5. User is redirected to dashboard

### Error Scenarios
1. **Invalid Email**: User enters invalid email format
2. **Duplicate Email**: User enters email that already exists
3. **Weak Password**: User enters password that doesn't meet requirements
4. **Password Mismatch**: User enters different passwords
5. **Network Error**: User loses connection during registration
6. **Rate Limiting**: User attempts registration too many times

### Edge Cases
1. **Very Long Names**: User enters name with 100 characters
2. **Special Characters**: User enters names with special characters
3. **Different Timezones**: User selects various timezone options
4. **Email with Subdomains**: User enters email with complex domain structure
