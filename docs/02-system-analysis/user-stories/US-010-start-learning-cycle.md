# US-010: Start Learning Cycle

## User Story

**As a** user  
**I want to** start a new learning cycle for a set  
**So that** I can begin or continue my spaced repetition learning process

## Story Details

### Background
Users need to be able to start learning cycles for their sets to begin the spaced repetition process. This includes initiating new cycles, resuming paused cycles, and managing the learning schedule according to the SRS algorithm.

### User Value
- Begin learning new sets effectively
- Resume learning after breaks
- Follow optimal learning schedules
- Track progress through learning cycles

### Business Value
- Enable core learning functionality
- Support spaced repetition methodology
- Improve learning outcomes
- Increase user engagement

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Start New Learning Cycle
**Given** I have a set that is not started  
**When** I choose to start learning  
**Then** the system should create a new learning cycle  
**And** the set status should change to "Learning"  
**And** I should see the first review scheduled  
**And** I should receive a confirmation message

### AC-002: Resume Paused Learning
**Given** I have a set that is paused  
**When** I choose to resume learning  
**Then** the system should reactivate the learning cycle  
**And** the set status should change back to "Learning"  
**And** I should see the next scheduled review  
**And** my previous progress should be preserved

### AC-003: Learning Cycle Information
**Given** I am starting a learning cycle  
**When** I view the cycle details  
**Then** I should see:
- Cycle number
- Total reviews in this cycle (5)
- Current review number
- Next review date and time
- Estimated completion date

### AC-004: Schedule First Review
**Given** I am starting a new learning cycle  
**When** the cycle is created  
**Then** the system should schedule the first review  
**And** the review should be scheduled for the next day  
**And** I should receive a notification about the scheduled review  
**And** I should see the review time in my local timezone

### AC-005: Learning Cycle Validation
**Given** I am trying to start a learning cycle  
**When** the system validates the request  
**Then** it should check that:
- The set exists and belongs to me
- The set is not already in an active learning state
- I have permission to start learning
- The set has valid content

### AC-006: Learning Cycle Settings
**Given** I am starting a learning cycle  
**When** I configure the cycle settings  
**Then** I should be able to set:
- Preferred review time
- Reminder frequency
- Learning intensity (normal/intensive)
- Review duration preferences

### AC-007: Learning Cycle Preview
**Given** I am about to start a learning cycle  
**When** I view the cycle preview  
**Then** I should see:
- Estimated timeline for the cycle
- Review schedule overview
- Expected learning outcomes
- Time commitment required

### AC-008: Learning Cycle Confirmation
**Given** I am starting a learning cycle  
**When** I confirm the action  
**Then** I should see a confirmation dialog  
**And** the dialog should show the cycle details  
**And** I should be able to modify settings before confirming  
**And** I should be able to cancel if needed

### AC-009: Learning Cycle Start Notification
**Given** I have successfully started a learning cycle  
**When** the cycle begins  
**Then** I should receive a notification  
**And** the notification should include:
- Set name and cycle information
- First review schedule
- Learning tips
- How to access the set

### AC-010: Learning Cycle Dashboard Update
**Given** I have started a learning cycle  
**When** I view my dashboard  
**Then** I should see the set in my active learning list  
**And** I should see the current cycle progress  
**And** I should see the next review date  
**And** I should see the set status as "Learning"

### AC-011: Learning Cycle with Existing Progress
**Given** I am starting a new cycle for a set with previous cycles  
**When** I begin the new cycle  
**Then** the system should consider previous performance  
**And** the schedule should be optimized based on past results  
**And** I should see a summary of previous cycles  
**And** the new cycle should build on previous learning

### AC-012: Learning Cycle Error Handling
**Given** I encounter an error starting a learning cycle  
**When** the system cannot start the cycle  
**Then** I should see a clear error message  
**And** I should be informed about what went wrong  
**And** I should see suggestions for resolving the issue  
**And** I should be able to retry the action

### AC-013: Learning Cycle with Multiple Sets
**Given** I am starting learning cycles for multiple sets  
**When** I start them simultaneously  
**Then** the system should schedule reviews to avoid conflicts  
**And** I should see a combined schedule overview  
**And** I should be warned if the schedule becomes too intensive  
**And** I should be able to adjust the schedule

### AC-014: Learning Cycle Reminder Setup
**Given** I am starting a learning cycle  
**When** the cycle is created  
**Then** the system should set up reminders for reviews  
**And** I should be able to customize reminder preferences  
**And** I should receive a test reminder to confirm settings  
**And** I should be able to modify reminders later

### AC-015: Learning Cycle Progress Tracking
**Given** I have started a learning cycle  
**When** I view the cycle progress  
**Then** I should see:
- Current review number
- Reviews completed
- Reviews remaining
- Progress percentage
- Time until next review

### AC-016: Learning Cycle Pause Option
**Given** I have an active learning cycle  
**When** I need to pause learning  
**Then** I should be able to pause the cycle  
**And** the system should preserve my progress  
**And** I should be able to resume later  
**And** I should see when the cycle was paused

### AC-017: Learning Cycle Completion Preview
**Given** I am starting a learning cycle  
**When** I view the completion preview  
**Then** I should see:
- Estimated completion date
- Total time commitment
- Expected learning outcomes
- What happens after cycle completion
