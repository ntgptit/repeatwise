# US-005: Create New Set

## User Story

**As a** student  
**I want to** create a new learning set  
**So that** I can organize my vocabulary and grammar learning materials

## Story Details

### Background
Students need to create learning sets to organize their study materials. Each set represents a specific topic, category, or learning unit that they want to study using the SRS method.

### User Value
- Organize learning materials by topic or category
- Track progress for specific learning units
- Customize learning experience
- Manage multiple subjects simultaneously

### Business Value
- User engagement through content organization
- Data collection for learning analytics
- Foundation for SRS algorithm implementation
- User retention through personalized learning

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Basic Set Creation
**Given** I am logged into the app  
**When** I choose to create a new set  
**Then** I should see a form with fields for set name, description, category, and word count  
**And** I should be able to fill out all required fields  
**And** I should receive immediate feedback on input validation

### AC-002: Set Name Validation
**Given** I am creating a new set  
**When** I enter a set name  
**Then** the system should accept names up to 100 characters  
**And** I should see an error if the name field is empty  
**And** I should see an error if the name exceeds 100 characters  
**And** I should see an error if the name already exists for my account

### AC-003: Description Field
**Given** I am creating a new set  
**When** I enter a description  
**Then** the system should accept descriptions up to 500 characters  
**And** the description field should be optional  
**And** I should see a character counter showing remaining characters

### AC-004: Category Selection
**Given** I am creating a new set  
**When** I select a category  
**Then** I should be able to choose from:
- Vocabulary
- Grammar
- Mixed
- Other
**And** the system should default to "Vocabulary"  
**And** I should see an icon and description for each category

### AC-005: Word Count Validation
**Given** I am creating a new set  
**When** I enter the word count  
**Then** the system should accept numbers greater than 0  
**And** the system should accept numbers up to 10,000  
**And** I should see an error if the word count is 0 or negative  
**And** I should see an error if the word count exceeds 10,000

### AC-006: Set Limit Check
**Given** I already have sets in my account  
**When** I try to create a new set  
**Then** the system should check if I have reached the limit of 100 sets  
**And** I should see a warning if I'm approaching the limit (e.g., 90+ sets)  
**And** I should see an error message if I've reached the limit

### AC-007: Preview Before Creation
**Given** I have filled out the set creation form  
**When** I review the information  
**Then** I should see a preview of how the set will appear  
**And** I should be able to edit any fields before finalizing  
**And** I should see a summary of the set details

### AC-008: Successful Set Creation
**Given** I have filled out all required fields correctly  
**When** I submit the set creation form  
**Then** the set should be created with a unique ID  
**And** the set should have status "not_started"  
**And** the set should have current_cycle = 1  
**And** I should be redirected to the set details page  
**And** I should see a success message

### AC-009: Set Details Display
**Given** I have successfully created a set  
**When** I view the set details  
**Then** I should see all the information I entered  
**And** I should see the set status and current cycle  
**And** I should see options to start learning or edit the set  
**And** I should see a progress indicator (0% since it's new)

### AC-010: Error Handling
**Given** I encounter an error during set creation  
**When** the system cannot create the set  
**Then** I should see a clear error message explaining what went wrong  
**And** I should be able to retry the creation process  
**And** my form data should be preserved

### AC-011: Network Error Handling
**Given** I lose internet connection during set creation  
**When** I try to submit the form  
**Then** I should see a network error message  
**And** I should have the option to retry when connection is restored  
**And** my form data should be saved locally

### AC-012: Accessibility
**Given** I am using assistive technology  
**When** I create a new set  
**Then** all form fields should have proper labels  
**And** error messages should be announced to screen readers  
**And** the form should be navigable using keyboard only  
**And** color should not be the only way to convey information

## Story Points

**Story Points**: 5 (Medium-low complexity)

### Complexity Factors
- Form validation and error handling
- Set limit checking
- Category management
- Network error handling
- Accessibility requirements

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **US-001**: User Registration (for user authentication)
- **US-002**: User Login (for user session)
- **Database Schema**: Sets table must be created
- **Category System**: Category management must be implemented
- **Validation Framework**: Form validation must be set up

### Business Dependencies
- **Content Strategy**: Category definitions must be finalized
- **User Limits**: Set limit policy must be defined
- **UI/UX**: Form design must be approved

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Set Limit Management**: Complex business logic for limit checking
- **Data Validation**: Multiple validation rules to implement
- **User Experience**: Form complexity could impact usability

### Medium Risk
- **Category Management**: Dynamic category system
- **Error Handling**: Multiple error scenarios to handle
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance requirements

### Low Risk
- **UI/UX**: Standard form design
- **Database**: Simple set table structure
- **Testing**: Standard testing approaches

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. User logs in and selects "Create New Set"
2. User fills out form with valid data
3. User submits form
4. Set is created and user is redirected to set details
5. User can see the new set in their set list

### Error Scenarios
1. **Empty Set Name**: User submits form without set name
2. **Long Set Name**: User enters name > 100 characters
3. **Invalid Word Count**: User enters word count = 0
4. **Duplicate Name**: User enters name that already exists
5. **Set Limit Reached**: User tries to create set when limit is reached
6. **Network Error**: User loses connection during creation

### Edge Cases
1. **Maximum Word Count**: User enters word count = 10,000
2. **Special Characters**: User enters names with special characters
3. **Long Description**: User enters description with 500 characters
4. **Different Categories**: User tests all category options
