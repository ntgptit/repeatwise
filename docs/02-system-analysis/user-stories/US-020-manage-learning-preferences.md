# US-020: Manage Learning Preferences

## User Story

**As a** user  
**I want to** manage my learning preferences  
**So that** I can customize my learning experience to match my style and goals

## Story Details

### Background
Users need to customize their learning experience by setting preferences for learning intensity, review frequency, difficulty levels, and other parameters that affect their spaced repetition learning process. These preferences help optimize the learning experience for individual needs and goals.

### User Value
- Customize learning experience to personal style
- Optimize learning efficiency and effectiveness
- Set appropriate difficulty levels
- Control learning pace and intensity
- Achieve better learning outcomes

### Business Value
- Improve user engagement through personalization
- Support adaptive learning algorithms
- Increase learning completion rates
- Enhance user satisfaction and retention
- Provide data for learning optimization
