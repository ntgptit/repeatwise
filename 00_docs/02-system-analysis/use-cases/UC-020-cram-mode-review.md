## 5. Main Success Scenario

### Step 1: Start Cram Mode
**Actor**: User opens deck "Academic Vocabulary" (100 cards, 20 due today) and clicks "Cram Mode"

**System**:
- Shows cram mode configuration dialog:
  - Total cards available: 100
  - Cards due today: 20
  - Cards to review: [All 100 cards ‚ñº]
  - Order: [Random ‚ñº]
  - Show answer time: ‚òë
- Provides options:
  - Review all cards (100)
  - Review due cards only (20)
  - Review specific box (1-7)
  - Custom range

### Step 2: Configure Cram Session
**Actor**: User selects:
- Cards to review: "All cards" (100)
- Order: "Random"
- Show answer time: Checked

**System**:
- Validates configuration
- Estimates time: "~15 minutes (100 cards √ó 9s avg)"
- Shows preview: "Cram 100 cards in random order"

### Step 3: Load Cards (No SRS Filtering)
**Actor**: User clicks "Start Cram Session"

**System**:
1. Queries all cards in deck (ignores due_date):
```sql
SELECT c.id, c.front, c.back
FROM cards c
WHERE c.deck_id = :deck_id
  AND c.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY RANDOM()  -- Random order
LIMIT 100;
```
2. Creates cram session record:
```sql
INSERT INTO cram_sessions (id, user_id, deck_id, total_cards, started_at)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), :user_id, :deck_id, 100, NOW());
```
3. Initializes session state:
   - Cards to review: 100
   - Current index: 0
   - Reviewed count: 0
   - Show answer time: TRUE

### Step 4: Review Cards (Show Front)
**System**:
- Shows card 1/100
- Displays front: "ubiquitous"
- Shows progress: "1 / 100"
- Shows timer (starts counting)
- Buttons: [Show Answer]

**Actor**: User reads front side for 3 seconds

### Step 5: Review Cards (Show Back)
**Actor**: User clicks "Show Answer"

**System**:
- Stops timer: 3s
- Shows back: "existing or being everywhere, especially at the same time; omnipresent"
- Shows answer time: "3s" (optional)
- Buttons: [Again] [Hard] [Good] [Easy]
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: "Cram mode: Your ratings won't affect card schedules"

**Actor**: User rates card "Good"

### Step 6: Record Cram Rating (No SRS Update)
**System**:
1. Records cram review result:
```sql
INSERT INTO cram_reviews (session_id, card_id, rating, answer_time_seconds)
VALUES (:session_id, :card_id, 'GOOD', 3);
```
2. **DOES NOT** update card_box_position:
   - No box change
   - No interval change
   - No due_date change
   - No lapse_count increment
3. Increments reviewed count: 1 ‚Üí 2
4. Loads next card (2/100)

**System**: Repeats Steps 4-6 for all 100 cards

### Step 7: Complete Cram Session
**System** (after last card):
- Ends session:
```sql
UPDATE cram_sessions SET
    ended_at = NOW(),
    cards_reviewed = 100,
    status = 'COMPLETED'
WHERE id = :session_id;
```
- Calculates statistics:
  - Total time: 12 minutes 30 seconds
  - Cards reviewed: 100
  - Average time per card: 7.5s
  - Ratings breakdown:
    - Again: 12 (12%)
    - Hard: 25 (25%)
    - Good: 50 (50%)
    - Easy: 13 (13%)

### Step 8: Display Cram Session Summary
**System**:
- Shows completion screen:
  - "üéâ Cram Session Complete!"
  - Deck: "Academic Vocabulary"
  - Cards reviewed: 100
  - Time: 12m 30s
  - Average: 7.5s per card
  - Ratings chart
- Options:
  - [Cram Again] (restart with same settings)
  - [Regular Review] (switch to SRS mode)
  - [Back to Deck]

**Actor**: User clicks "Back to Deck" or continues studying

## 6. Alternative Flows

### A1: Cram Due Cards Only
**Trigger**: User selects "Due cards only" (Step 2)

**Flow**:
1. User selects: "Review due cards only" (20 cards)
2. System queries only due cards:
```sql
SELECT c.id, c.front, c.back
FROM cards c
JOIN card_box_position cbp ON cbp.card_id = c.id
WHERE c.deck_id = :deck_id
  AND cbp.due_date <= CURRENT_DATE
  AND c.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 20;
```
3. Cram session includes only 20 cards
4. Review proceeds normally (Steps 4-8)

**Continue to**: Step 8

---

### A2: Cram Specific Box
**Trigger**: User selects "Specific box" (Step 2)

**Flow**:
1. User selects: "Box 1 only" (new/difficult cards)
2. System queries cards in Box 1:
```sql
SELECT c.id, c.front, c.back
FROM cards c
JOIN card_box_position cbp ON cbp.card_id = c.id
WHERE c.deck_id = :deck_id
  AND cbp.current_box = 1
  AND c.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY RANDOM();
```
3. Found: 15 cards in Box 1
4. Cram session includes 15 cards
5. Review proceeds

**Continue to**: Step 8

---

### A3: Exit Cram Session Early
**Trigger**: User clicks "Exit" during review (Step 5)

**Flow**:
1. User clicks "Exit" after reviewing 40/100 cards
2. System shows confirmation: "Exit cram session? You've reviewed 40/100 cards."
3. User confirms exit
4. System saves partial session:
```sql
UPDATE cram_sessions SET
    ended_at = NOW(),
    cards_reviewed = 40,
    status = 'INCOMPLETE'
WHERE id = :session_id;
```
5. Returns to deck view
6. Shows toast: "Cram session paused. Reviewed 40 cards."

**End Use Case**

---

### A4: Cram Mode with Ascending Order
**Trigger**: User selects "Ascending" order (Step 2)

**Flow**:
1. User selects order: "Ascending" (easier cards first)
2. System orders by current_box ASC:
```sql
ORDER BY cbp.current_box ASC, RANDOM()
```
3. Cards shown: Box 1 ‚Üí Box 2 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Box 7
4. Review proceeds

**Continue to**: Step 8

---

### A5: Repeat Failed Cards
**Trigger**: User wants to re-cram cards rated "Again" (Step 8)

**Flow**:
1. User completes cram session (12 cards rated "Again")
2. System offers: "Repeat cards you rated 'Again'?"
3. User clicks "Yes"
4. System creates new cram session with only those 12 cards
5. Review proceeds with filtered cards

**Continue to**: Step 3 (with 12 cards)

---

### A6: Empty Deck - No Cards to Cram
**Trigger**: Deck has 0 cards (Step 1)

**Flow**:
1. User opens empty deck and clicks "Cram Mode"
2. System detects 0 cards
3. System shows message: "No cards available for cramming"
4. System suggests: "Add cards to start studying"
5. User cancels

**End Use Case**

### Database Changes

**Create Cram Session**:
```sql
INSERT INTO cram_sessions (id, user_id, deck_id, total_cards, started_at, status)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), :user_id, :deck_id, :total_cards, NOW(), 'IN_PROGRESS');
```

**Record Cram Review**:
```sql
-- Store review (NO UPDATE to card_box_position!)
INSERT INTO cram_reviews (session_id, card_id, rating, answer_time_seconds, reviewed_at)
VALUES (:session_id, :card_id, :rating, :answer_time, NOW());
```

**Complete Session**:
```sql
UPDATE cram_sessions SET
    ended_at = NOW(),
    cards_reviewed = :reviewed_count,
    status = :status  -- 'COMPLETED' or 'INCOMPLETE'
WHERE id = :session_id;
```

**Query Cards for Cram**:
```sql
-- All cards
SELECT c.id, c.front, c.back, cbp.current_box
FROM cards c
LEFT JOIN card_box_position cbp ON cbp.card_id = c.id
WHERE c.deck_id = :deck_id AND c.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY RANDOM();

-- Due cards only
SELECT c.id, c.front, c.back
FROM cards c
JOIN card_box_position cbp ON cbp.card_id = c.id
WHERE c.deck_id = :deck_id
  AND cbp.due_date <= CURRENT_DATE
  AND c.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY RANDOM();

-- Specific box
SELECT c.id, c.front, c.back
FROM cards c
JOIN card_box_position cbp ON cbp.card_id = c.id
WHERE c.deck_id = :deck_id
  AND cbp.current_box = :box_number
  AND c.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY RANDOM();
```

2. Review all 100 cards
3. Rate cards with different ratings
4. Complete session
5. Verify NO changes to card_box_position
6. Verify cram_reviews recorded
7. Verify statistics displayed

### Alternative Scenarios
1. Cram due cards only ‚Üí 20 cards shown
2. Cram specific box (Box 1) ‚Üí Only Box 1 cards
3. Exit early after 40 cards ‚Üí Partial session saved
4. Repeat failed cards ‚Üí New session with 12 cards

### Edge Cases
1. Cram empty deck ‚Üí Error message
2. Cram deck with 1 card ‚Üí Should work
3. Cram session with all "Again" ratings ‚Üí Statistics accurate
4. Cram very large deck (1000 cards) ‚Üí Performance OK

### Critical Tests (SRS Isolation)
1. **Verify card_box_position unchanged after cram**
2. **Verify due_date unchanged**
3. **Verify interval_days unchanged**
4. **Verify lapse_count unchanged**
5. Regular SRS review after cram ‚Üí Uses original schedule

### Error Cases
1. Start cram with no cards ‚Üí Error
2. Start cram with deleted deck ‚Üí Error
3. Network failure during cram ‚Üí Session recoverable
